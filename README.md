mpukviewr
=========

Daemon and Rails application for viewr.

license
=========
Before using this project yourself, there are some portions of it under a
proprietary license as they were made by @CosmicDuck (twitter) rather than
myself. LICENSE sets out all of these exceptions.

This project is released for noncommercial use under a Creative Commons
CC-BY-NC-SA license (see LICENSE). Why? Because I want to make it free (as in
beer) for noncommercial use (i.e. nonprofit events), NOT because I am under the
illusion that using a CC-BY-NC-SA license turns viewr into true 'Open Source
Software'.
